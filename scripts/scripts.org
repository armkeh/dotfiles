#+Title: Shell scripts
#+Author: Mark Armstrong
#+Description: My collection of simple shell scripts.

* Detect (and optionally delete) trash files

Only finding implemented for now.
:TODO: Prompt to delete the files.
#+begin_src sh :tangle ./find-trash-files.sh :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
find . -name "*~"
find . -name "~#"
#+end_src

* Detect (and optionally delete) Syncthing conflict files

Same state as above. Probably these should rely on a more general script.
#+begin_src sh :tangle ./find-syncthing-conflicts.sh :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
find . -name "*.sync-conflict-*"
#+end_src
