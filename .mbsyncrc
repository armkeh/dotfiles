Create Both

# Propogate mailbox deletion from the server to the local machine.
# This will only remove empty mailboxes.
# Don't go the other way, for safety.

# Automatically expunge deleted emails both locally and on the server.
# By the recommendations in the isync man page, we turn this on.
Expunge Both

# The state of mailboxes is saved to the mailboxes themselves.
# This means we do not have to manually clean up
