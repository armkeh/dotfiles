#+Title: My literate Syncthing settings

#+Description: A literate setup for Syncthing.

* Introduction

[[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] is “a *continuous file synchonization* program”.
I use it as a “personal cloud storage” solution,
though it is not truly cloud storage;
everything is stored on my machines only.

I have found Syncthing very easy and intuitive to use,
and together with a backup solution on one of the synced machines,
it has perfectly replaced cloud storage solutions for me.

* Supervisor entry for auto-starting Syncthing

This file creates an entry for Syncthing with Supervisor,
for the purpose of automatically starting Syncthing on system boot.
Put a symbolic link to this file in ~/etc/supervisor/conf.d/~.
#+begin_src conf :tangle ./conf/syncthing.conf
[program:syncthing]
autorestart = True
directory = /home/markparmstrong
user = markparmstrong
command = /usr/bin/syncthing -no-browser -home="/home/markparmstrong/.config/syncthing"
environment = STNORESTART="1", HOME="/home/markparmstrong"
#+end_src
