#+Title: My dotfiles
#+Author: Mark Armstrong
#+Description: README for my system setup (dot) files repository.
#+Options: toc:nil

This repository contains my “dotfiles”, i.e.,
the various configurations and settings for my machine(s).

Of particular note are my [[./emacs][Emacs]] configuration files.

See also my settings for [[./shell.org][shells and terminal emulators]],
and for:
- [[./mbsync.org][mbsync]] (isync), my e-mail mailbox synchroniser.
- [[./syncthing.org][Syncthing]], my “cloud storage” solution
  (which doesn't actually involve a “cloud”.)
