#+Title: Consistent Window Splits

#+Description: An Emacs package to enforce consistent window splitting behavior
#+Description: across different screen sizes.

~consistent-window-splits~ is an Emacs package to enforce
consistent window splitting behavior across different screen sizes.

The enforcement this package puts on window splitting is opinionated;
it is mainly intended to control automatic splitting of windows,
but it can also prevent the user from making manual splits.
This package may not be suitable if you find being prevented from
arbitrarily splitting windows to be irritating.
# TODO: Functions are included to toggle the enforcement and allow
# the user to manually split the window as desired, if needed.

It is primarily useful when using Emacs on a widescreen or ultrawide
monitor in fullscreen mode, if you find that
the default behavior of Emacs results in too many horizontal splits.
(E.g., you prefer using 2 columns of windows, but Emacs often
 opens a 3rd of even 4th.)

* Features

Emacs primarily uses two variables per dimension (horizontal/vertical)
for deciding how to split windows:
- ~split-width-threshold~ & ~split-height-threshold~:
  The minimum width/height (in columns/rows) at which a window
  may be split by the function ~split-window-sensibly~,
  which is commonly called implicitely when a new buffer is opened by
  a command or process (for instance, ~describe-symbol~, ~magit~, ).
- ~window-min-width~ & ~window-min-height~:
  The absolute minimum width/height (in columns/rows) of any window;
  /any/ split (not just sensible splits) which would result
  in a window becoming less than this size will not be allowed
  (including manual splits requested by the user, e.g.,
   with ~C-x 2~ or ~C-x 3~).

~consistent-window-splits~ provides functions to override those values
in order to prevent undesired splitting behavior,
and also includes an option to add a function to the ~window-size-change-functions~
which automatically update those values appropriately
when the frame (OS window) size changes.

* Installation

CLone this repository and add it to your ~load-path~, or
alternatively use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] to manage the installation.

* Usage

To enable automatic consistent window splitting behavior,
add this to your init:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(consistent-window-splits-automatically-optimize)
#+end_src
It will add the automation to the ~window-size-change-functions~.
