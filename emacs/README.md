This repository contains the files that make up my Emacs setup.

For the moment, that is my (literate) Emacs initialisation file and my
`yankpad` file of snippets.

# `emacs-init.org`

## Introduction

This is my `emacs` initialisation code, documented for my own
understanding in the future and for sharing with others.

I'm following [Musa Alhassy's](https://alhassy.github.io/init/) example
using an `org` file for this.

### About me

``` commonlisp
(setq user-full-name "Mark Armstrong")
(setq user-mail-address "markparmstrong@gmail.com")
```

### Setting up `.emacs` to use this code

Create a symbolic link to this file in `~/.emacs.d/`, then add to the
bottom of `~/.emacs` these lines:

``` example
;; BEGIN my edits

;; I've set up an init file following Musa's guide:
;; https://alhassy.github.io/init/

;; Enable Emacs VC on symlinked files
(setq vc-follow-symlinks t)

;; Evaluate my init file.
(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/emacs-init.org")

;; Byte compile the file so that changes to emacs-init.org get picked up.
(byte-compile-file "~/.emacs")

;; END my edits
```

1.  Why set `vc-follow-symlinks` here?
    
    It's a setting I want anyway (it ensures Emacs's version control
    works correctly on the target file), but why set it in `.emacs`?
    
    Since `.emacs` uses a symlink to this version controlled file,
    having Emacs prompt me every time is annoying and slows my start up.

### Set a “custom” file

Emacs will, by default, insert all sorts of “custom” settings into our
`.emacs` file (or whichever of the default init locations we use),
especially those set via GUIs.

In order to avoid polluting that file, let's set it to use a particular
one. In fact, let's put it under my version control, so I will notice
changes to it.

``` commonlisp
(setq custom-file "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/custom.el")
(ignore-errors (load custom-file))
```

## `elisp` code

This section defines some functions/variables referred to below, that
either don't fit in a particular place below, or may be of general use.

### Theme change hook

[Apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4v7tcj/), there is
no hook in Emacs for when a theme change occurs. This code snippet,
taken from the linked reddit post, defines one I can use.

``` commonlisp
(defvar after-load-theme-hook nil
  "Hook run after a color theme is loaded using `load-theme'.")
(defadvice load-theme (after run-after-load-theme-hook activate)
  "Run `after-load-theme-hook'."
  (run-hooks 'after-load-theme-hook))
```

### Cascading window setup

I set up my default desktop using a “cascading pattern”, moving from
larger windows in the upper right to smaller windows in the lower left.

This works best with 2 or 3 windows, but it can be used for more.

The process is:

  - If there are two or more files left to open:
      - Create a new window to the left.
      - Open the next file.
      - Move the focus to the left.
      - If there are two or more files left to open:
          - Create a new window below.
          - Open the next file.
          - Move focus down.
  - Else if there is one file left to open, open it.
  - Else, quit.

<!-- end list -->

``` commonlisp
(defun cascading-find-files (files)
  "Opens a set of files in a cascading series of windows,
created by splitting the current window.
The windows begin in the upper right, with the first file,
and move left and then down, each window being half the size
of the previous (as long as this is possible)."
  (while files ;; there's at least one file to open
    (find-file (car files))
    (setq files (cdr files))
    (when files ;; there are two or more files
      (split-window nil nil 'left)
      (other-window 1)
      (find-file (car files)) ;; open second file on the left
      (setq files  (cdr files))
      (when files ;; there are still more files, so split horizontally
        (split-window nil nil 'below)
        (other-window 1)))))
```

## Various packages

### Package repositories and `use-package`

``` commonlisp
(require 'package)
(setq package-archives
   '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
     ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
     ("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")))
(package-initialize)
```

1.  Set the load path for manually downloaded packages
    
    Also used as a scratch directory when I'm working on a package.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/downloaded-packages")
    ```

2.  Bootstrap `use-package`
    
    Using `use-package` allows me to easily migrate to new systems,
    because I don't have to `package-install` every package I use.
    
    Unless it's already installed, update the packages archives, then
    install the most recent version of “use-package”.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
      (package-refresh-contents)
      (package-install 'use-package))
    
    (require 'use-package)
    ```
    
    I always want to download packages that aren't installed.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
    ```

3.  Update packages
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package auto-package-update
      :config
      ;; Delete residual old versions
      (setq auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t)
      ;; Do not bother me when updates have taken place.
      (setq auto-package-update-hide-results t)
      ;; Update installed packages at startup if there is an update pending.
      (auto-package-update-maybe))
    ```

### `eshell`

``` commonlisp
(use-package eshell)
```

`em-dirs` is usually loaded upon starting an `eshell` process; I make
use of a function from it below, so to avoid warnings when compiling
here I load this file.

``` commonlisp
(load "em-dirs")
```

Jeremias Queiroz posted a “fancy eshell prompt” setup on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6f0rkz/my_fancy_eshell_prompt/),
from which I derived this setup, but I've modified it to use builtin
face colours to improve portability across themes.

``` commonlisp
(setq eshell-prompt-function
(lambda ()
  (let ((white  `(face-attribute 'default :foreground))
        (green  `(face-attribute 'success :foreground))
        (red    `(face-attribute 'error   :foreground))
        (blue   `(face-attribute 'link    :foreground))
        (yellow `(face-attribute 'warning :foreground)))
  (concat
  (propertize "┌—["             'face green)
  (propertize (user-login-name)     'face red)
  (propertize "@"                   'face blue)
  (propertize (system-name)         'face red)
  (propertize "]──["                'face green)
  (propertize (format-time-string "%a %b %d" (current-time)) 'face yellow)
  (propertize "]──["                'face green)
  (propertize (format-time-string "%H:%M" (current-time)) 'face yellow)
  (propertize "]\n"                 'face green)
  (propertize "│ "                  'face green)
  (propertize (concat (eshell/pwd)) 'face blue)
  (propertize "\n"                 'face green)
  (propertize "└─►"                 'face green)
  (propertize (if (= (user-uid) 0) " # " " $ ") 'face white))
)))
```

### `agda` mode

We need Emacs to locate Agda mode. This command is put in `.emacs`

``` commonlisp
(load-file (let ((coding-system-for-read 'utf-8))
                (shell-command-to-string "agda-mode locate")))
```

These packages are installed when setting up Agda, so I simply `require`
them. :TODO: is this required because I am activating Agda input mode
everywhere?

``` commonlisp
(require 'agda-input)
(require 'agda2-highlight)
```

1.  Command line arguments
    
    Dr. Wolfram Kahl has recommended customising the following settings.
    Note that my machine is a virtual machine running on a Chromebook
    which, at time of writing (January 2020) has around `6G` (out of the
    system's total `8G`) available to it.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq agda2-program-args (quote ("+RTS" "-M4G" "-H4G" "-A128M" "-RTS")))
    ```
    
    These arguments specify
    
    |                |                                                        |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `+RTS`, `-RTS` | Flags between these are arguments to the `ghc` runtime |
    | `-M[size]`     | Maximum heap size                                      |
    | `-H[size]`     | Suggested heap size                                    |
    | `-A[size]`     | Allocation area size used by the garbage collector     |
    

    Full documentation for the `ghc` runtime argumentscan be found
    [here](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/runtime-control.html).
    
    Additional arguments that may be useful include
    
    |            |                                                                |
    | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `-S[file]` | Produces information about “each and every garbage collection” |
    |            | \- Outputs to `stderr` by default                              |
    

2.  Alternative problem highlighting
    
    I find the background coloring used by Agda for incomplete pattern
    matching, redundant clauses and clauses which do not hold
    definitionally hard to read in general, and usually unreadable with
    different themes.
    
    So I use set other indicators instead.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (defun my-agda-highlighting ()
      "Set face attributes to replace Agda highlighting,
      which I find hard to read in many situations."
      (set-face-attribute
        'agda2-highlight-coverage-problem-face
        nil ;; all frames
        :background nil
        :underline "dark red"
      )
      (set-face-attribute
        'agda2-highlight-deadcode-face
        nil ;; all frames
        :background nil
        :strike-through t
      )
      (set-face-attribute
        'agda2-highlight-catchall-clause-face
        nil ;; all frames
        :background nil
        :slant 'italic
      )
    )
    
    (add-hook 'agda2-mode-hook 'my-agda-highlighting)
    ```

3.  Add unicode characters to Agda's translations
    
    1.  Punctuation and parentheses
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '(";;" "﹔"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '(";;" "⨾"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("|" "❙"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("st" "•"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("{" "｛"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("}" "｝"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("{" "⁅"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("}" "⁆"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("..." "…"))
        ```
    
    2.  Arrows
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("into" "↪"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("onto" "↠"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("conv" "↓"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("=v" "⇓"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("eval" "⇓"))
        ```
    
    3.  Correct mistakes on subscripts/superscripts
        
        I often accidentally hold the shift key for too long when
        entering subscripts and superscripts; these translations account
        for that.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^!" "¹"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^@" "²"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^#" "³"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^$" "⁴"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^%" "⁵"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^^" "⁶"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^&" "⁷"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^*" "⁸"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^(" "⁹"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^)" "⁰"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_!" "₁"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_@" "₂"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_#" "₃"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_$" "₄"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_%" "₅"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_^" "₆"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_&" "₇"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_*" "₈"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_(" "₉"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("_)" "₀"))
        ```
    
    4.  Emoticons
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '(":)" "😀"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '(":D" "😁"))
        ```
        
        😁
    
    5.  Calccheck
        
        TODO
    
    6.  Better access to prime symbols
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("''" "″"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("'''" "‴"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("''''" "⁗"))
        ```
    
    7.  Other
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("op" "⊕"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("^<" "﹤"))
        (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("powset" "℘"))
        ```
    
    8.  Activate the new additions
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (agda-input-setup)
        ```

4.  Activate Agda input mode in `text` and `prog` modes
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
           (lambda () (set-input-method "Agda")))
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
           (lambda () (set-input-method "Agda")))
    ```

5.  Org Agda mode
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (require 'org-agda-mode)
    ```

### Other programming languages

1.  Racket
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package racket-mode)
    ```

2.  F\#
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;;(require 'fsharp-mode)
    ```

3.  Prolog
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                     '("\\.pl\\'" . prolog-mode))
    ```

4.  Scheme
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package geiser)
    ```

### Org mode

I use Org for almost everything, and utilise many of the extras included
in `org-plus-contrib`.

``` commonlisp
(use-package org
  :ensure org-plus-contrib
  :config
  (require 'ox-extra)
)
```

1.  Capture
    
    I'm beginning to use `org-capture` to enable me to log ideas/TODO
    items from anywhere in Emacs in my log file.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-default-notes-file "~/Dropbox/Organisation/log/log.org")
    ```
    
    Currently I just use the default capture template, and manually
    organise ideas later. Once I use this system for a while, I should
    ideally set up other templates to automate some of this.

2.  Agenda
    
    My log file is my agenda.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/Organisation/log/log.org"))
    ```

3.  Speed keys
    
    Speed keys are single keystrokes which execute commands in an `org`
    file when the cursor is at the start of a headline.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-use-speed-commands t)
    ```
    
    To see the commands available, execute
    
    ``` example
    (org-speed-command-help)
    ```

4.  Exporting
    
    1.  Allow for ignoring headlines and/or subtrees
        
        Use the `:ignore:` tag on headlines to omit the headline when
        exporting, but keep its contents.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
        ```
        
        Alternatively, use the `:noexport:` tag to omit the headline
        *and* its contents.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;;;; noexport is in the list by default
        ;; (add-to-list 'org-export-exclude-tags "noexport")
        ```
    
    2.  Source code block indentation and colouring
        
        I want to preserve my indentation for source code during export.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
        ```
        
        The `htmlize` package preserves source code colouring on export
        to html. (And presumably does a lot more I am not fully aware
        of).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package htmlize)
        ```
    
    3.  Export in the background
        
        Using `latex-mk`, the export process for LaTeX takes a bit of
        time. Tying up emacs during that time is annoying, so set the
        export to happen in the background. This setting can be modified
        locally in the export dialog frame if desired by adding `C-a` to
        the export key sequence..
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;; TODO: this is broken for some unknown reason; I regularly get
        ;; illegal syntax # errors when trying to export.
        ;;(setq org-export-in-background t)
        ```
        
        This works by spawning a new Emacs session in which the file is
        exported. By default, that session would use this init file, but
        that's overkill and wastes time; most of this init is not
        relevant for that session. So, we'll set a different init file,
        constructed from the relevant portions of this file.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-export-async-init-file
          "~/.emacs.d/org-async-init.el") 
        ```
        
        Some default settings.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;; Org export init, tangled from my Emacs init
        (require 'package)
        (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
        (package-initialize)
        
        (require 'org)
        (require 'ox)
        (require 'ox-extra)
        
        (setq org-export-async-debug t)
        ```
        
        These settings are from this exporting section.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
        ;;;; noexport is in the list by default
        ;; (add-to-list 'org-export-exclude-tags "noexport")
        (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
        (use-package htmlize)
        (setq org-html-link-org-files-as-html nil)
        (setq org-latex-compiler "lualatex")
        (setq org-latex-pdf-process
              '("latexmk -%latex -f %f"))
        (add-to-list
          'org-latex-classes
            '("report-noparts"
              "\\documentclass{report}"
              ("\\chapter{%s}" . "\\chapter*{%s}")
              ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
              ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
              ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
              ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")

        ```
    
    4.  Don't change `.org` links to `.html`
        
        By default (see the
        [manual](https://orgmode.org/manual/Links-in-HTML-export.html))
        when exporting to HTML, Org will change `.org` links to `.html`.
        I don't want this; for instance, when teaching a course, I like
        to link to both a generated HTML file and the original Org
        source version of notes (on my generated course homepage).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-html-link-org-files-as-html nil)
        ```
    
    5.  LaTeX specific
        
        1.  Default LaTeX compiler
            
            I use a lot of unicode, and I find `xelatex` and `lualatex`
            handle that more easily than `pdflatex`.
            
            From my experience so far, they seem pretty interchangable
            for my purposes, so the decision of which to use is
            arbitrary.
            
            Based on [this discussion on Stack
            Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/36/differences-between-luatex-context-and-xetex),
            LuaTeX seems the more “up and coming” engine, so I'm using
            it at least until something breaks.
            
            ``` commonlisp
            (setq org-latex-compiler "lualatex")
            ```
        
        2.  LaTeX compilation process
            
            I use `latexmk` to automatically run as many passes as
            needed to resolve references, etc.
            
            ``` commonlisp
            (setq org-latex-pdf-process
                  '("latexmk -%latex -f %f"))
            ```
            
            The flags/format specifiers are
            
            |          |                                                                  |
            | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
            | `%latex` | stands in for the latex compiler (defaults to the setting above) |
            | `-f`     | force continued processing past errors                           |
            | `%f`     | stands in for the (relative) filename                            |
            

            Other flags/format specifiers I may wish to add later
            include
            
            |                 |                           |
            | --------------- | ------------------------- |
            | `-shell-escape` | necessary to use `minted` |
            

        3.  Custom document classes
            
            I want a `report` class that begins with `chapter`'s, rather
            than `part`'s.
            
            ``` commonlisp
            (add-to-list
              'org-latex-classes
                '("report-noparts"
                  "\\documentclass{report}"
                  ("\\chapter{%s}" . "\\chapter*{%s}")
                  ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                  ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                  ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
            ```
            
            Sometimes, for creating slides, `beamer` is useful. (Though
            I try to avoid it now; it feels low level to me).
            
            ``` commonlisp
            (add-to-list
              'org-latex-classes
                '("beamer"
                  "\\documentclass[presentation]{beamer}"
                  ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")))
            ```
        
        4.  Source code colouring in LaTeX exports
            
            We can use `minted` for source code colouring on export to
            LaTeX.
            
            Currently this breaks things with my literate Agda process,
            a problem I should resolve. For the moment, if I want to use
            `minted`, I can do so on a file-by-file basis.
            
            `pygments` (also called `python-pygments`) must be installed
            on the system for this to work.
            
            ``` commonlisp
            ;;(setq org-latex-listings 'minted
            ;;      org-latex-packages-alist '(("" "minted")))
            ```
        
        5.  `hyperref` setup
            
            ``` commonlisp
            (setq org-latex-hyperref-template
              "\\hypersetup{
               pdfauthor={%a},
               pdftitle={%t},
               pdfkeywords={%k},
               pdfsubject={%d},
               pdfcreator={%c},
               pdflang={%L},
               colorlinks,
               linkcolor=blue,
               citecolor=blue,
               urlcolor=blue
               }
            "
            )
            ```
    
    6.  `org-reveal`
        
        I make use of `org-reveal` to create `reveal.js` slide decks.
        This is way easier than dealing with `beamer` in LaTeX, and
        results in much more attractive and better organised slides.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package ox-reveal)
        
        (setq org-reveal-root "file:///home/markparmstrong/Dropbox/Organisation/downloaded/reveal.js-3.8.0/")
        ```
        
        1.  Slide appearance
            
            1.  Theme
                
                `reveal.js` comes with many themes; `black` is the
                current default at time of writing this. I set it just
                to be sure it stays consistent.
                
                ``` commonlisp
                (setq org-reveal-theme "black")
                ```
                
                At the time of writing, the included themes are
                
                  - `black`: Black background, white text, blue links
                  - `white`: White background, black text, blue links
                  - `league`: Gray background, white text, blue links
                  - `beige`: Beige background, dark text, brown links
                  - `sky`: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links
                  - `night`: Black background, thick white text, orange
                    links
                  - `serif`: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown
                    links
                  - `simple`: White background, black text, blue links
                  - `solarized`: Cream-colored background, dark green
                    text, blue links
                
                (list from the [`reveal.js`
                github](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#theming)).
            
            2.  Title page
                
                The default title slide includes title and date, with
                the formatting
                
                ``` html
                <h1 class="title">%t</h1>
                <p class="date">Created: %d/p>
                ```
                
                where `%t` stands for the document title and `%d` stands
                for the date. I override this setting
                
                ``` commonlisp
                (setq org-reveal-title-slide
                  "<h2 class=\"title\">%t</h2>
                   <h3>%s</h3>
                   <h4>%a</h4>
                   <h5>%d</h5>")
                ```
            
            3.  Default slide height, width, margin and scaling
                
                These settings are depricated; I need to remove this.
                
                ``` commonlisp
                ;;(setq org-reveal-height 5000)
                ;;(setq org-reveal-width 1200)
                ;;(setq org-reveal-margin "0.1")
                ;;(setq org-reveal-min-scale "0.05")
                ;;(setq org-reveal-max-scale "5")
                ```
            
            4.  Extra CSS
                
                I should set this up.
                
                ``` commonlisp
                (setq org-reveal-extra-css "")
                ```
    
    7.  `ox-pandoc`
        
        `ox-pandoc` is “another exporter that translates Org-mode file
        to various other formats via Pandoc”.
        
        I don't make much use of it, but it more flexible, and so has
        lots of options which make be useful in the future.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package ox-pandoc)
        ```
    
    8.  `ox-tufte`
        
        (This section is deprecated; I now use
        [Read-the-Org](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes/blob/master/README.org)
        as the theme for my websites).
        
        At one point I considered using [Tufte
        CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) for websites;
        `ox-tufte` exports is a package to export `html` which is nicely
        compatible with this style sheet. See the Github readme
        [here](https://github.com/dakrone/ox-tufte).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;(use-package ox-tufte)
        ```
        
        I found `ox-tufte` mentioned in a [Reddit
        thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6r32q4)
        regarding CSS for Org html export.
    
    9.  Ensure useful HTML anchors
        
        This code snippet is borrowed from Musa's
        [init](https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d/#Ensuring-Useful-HTML-Anchors).
        
        > Upon HTML export, each tree heading is assigned an ID to be
        > used for hyperlinks. Default IDs are something like
        > org1957a9d, which does not endure the test of time: Re-export
        > will produce a different id. Here's a rough snippet to
        > generate IDs from headings, by replacing spaces with hyphens,
        > for headings without IDs.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (defun my/ensure-headline-ids (&rest _)
          "Org trees without a :CUSTOM_ID: property have the property
           set to be their heading.
        
           If multiple trees end-up with the same id property,
           issue a message and undo any property insertion thus far.
          "
          (interactive)
          (let ((ids))
            (org-map-entries
             (lambda ()
               (org-with-point-at (point)
                 (let ((id (org-entry-get nil "CUSTOM_ID")))
                   (unless id
                     (setq id (s-replace " " "-" (nth 4 (org-heading-components))))
                     (if (not (member id ids))
                         (push id ids)
                       (message-box "Oh no, a repeated id!\n\n\t%s" id)
                       (undo)
                       (setq quit-flag t))
                     (org-entry-put nil "CUSTOM_ID" id))))))))
        
        ;; Whenever html & md export happens, ensure we have headline ids.
        (advice-add 'org-html-export-to-html :before 'my/ensure-headline-ids)
        (advice-add 'org-md-export-to-markdown :before 'my/ensure-headline-ids)
        ```
    
    10. Require `{}` to denote sub/superscripts
        
        Sometimes I want to export the characters `_` or `^`. However,
        Org allows these to be used for LaTeX style sub/superscripts, so
        a lone `_` will be exported (to LaTeX at least) as `\_{}` (and
        similarly for a lone `^`).
        
        In order to avoid this, but still allow for LaTeX style
        sub/superscripts, we can use a setting to *require* that
        sub/superscripts be enclosed in brackets (which is my preference
        in any case).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})
        ```

5.  Evaluating code
    
    By default, Emacs will query whether we *actually* want to execute
    code when we evaluate a code block. Also, it seems to just *not*
    execute code marked for execution during export in an `org` file.
    So, I remove the safety.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
    ```
    
    By default only emacs lisp can be evaluated. Documentation
    [here](https://orgmode.org/manual/Languages.html).
    
    These languages have support built-in, it just has to be activated.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (require 'ob-shell)
    (require 'ob-haskell)
    (require 'ob-latex)
    (require 'ob-C)
    (require 'ob-ruby)
    (require 'ob-plantuml)
    (require 'ob-R)
    (require 'ob-ditaa)
    (require 'ob-scheme)
    ```
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-ditaa-jar-path "/usr/bin/ditaa")
    ```
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq geiser-default-implementation 'guile)
    ```
    
    For other languages, separate packages are needed.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;;(use-package ob-fsharp)
    ```
    
    `ob-oz` comes with a Mozart2 installation; if there's a problem,
    make sure the Mozart2 Elisp directory is in the path.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (require 'ob-oz)
    ```
    
    There are at least two packages for Org babel support for Racket,
    but neither are on MELPA. Neither one seems to stand out as more or
    less fully featured.
    
      - [emacs-ob-racket](https://github.com/hasu/emacs-ob-racket) is
        more recently maintained.
      - [ob-racket](https://github.com/xchrishawk/ob-racket) has not
        been updated in 4 years.
    
    So I choose `emacs-ob-racket`. For the moment, I just saved it to my
    `emacs.d`; probably it should be put somewhere better, but I will do
    that when I next set up my system 😀.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/markparmstrong/.emacs.d/ob-racket")
    (require 'ob-racket)
    ```
    
    For shell code, we need to initialise via this function. See
    [here](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/37692/how-to-fix-symbols-function-definition-is-void-org-babel-get-header).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (org-babel-shell-initialize)
    ```
    
    PlantUML requires we set the path to the `.jar` file.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq org-plantuml-jar-path "/usr/share/java/plantuml.jar")
    ```
    
    It's convenient to have `<tab>` act as it would in the source
    language when editing code blocks.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;;(setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
    ```

6.  Cosmetics
    
    1.  Indent text based on heading by default
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-startup-indented t)
        ```
    
    2.  Hide emphasis markers by default
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
        ```
        
        It is convenient to show the emphasis markers around point.
        Otherwise it becomes tedious to edit emphasised text.
        
        There have been a couple Reddit posts seeking to solve this
        problem. First, [this
        code](https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/43uuck/) which
        doesn't work for all emphasis markers.
        
        ``` example
        (defun org-show-emphasis-markers-at-point ()
          (save-match-data
            (if (and (org-in-regexp org-emph-re 2)
                     (>= (point) (match-beginning 3))
                     (<= (point) (match-end 4))
                     (member (match-string 3) (mapcar 'car org-emphasis-alist)))
                (with-silent-modifications
                 (remove-text-properties
                  (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5)
                   '(invisible org-link)))
              (apply 'font-lock-flush (list (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5))))))
        ```
        
        Then, [this more recent
        code](https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/dj5u1y) which
        adds more checks. However, it seems to lag input a bit?
        
        ``` example
        (defun sbr-org-toggle-emphasis-markers-at-point ()
          (interactive)
          (save-match-data
            (when (or (org-in-regexp org-emph-re 2)
                      (org-in-regexp org-verbatim-re 2))
              (if (and (>= (point) (match-beginning 3))
                       (<= (point) (match-end 4))
                       (member (match-string 3) (mapcar 'car org-emphasis-alist))
                       (get-text-property (match-beginning 3) 'invisible))
                  (with-silent-modifications
                    (remove-text-properties
                     (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5)
                     '(invisible org-link)))
                (apply 'font-lock-flush (list (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5)))))))
        ```
        
        This is my attempt, combining the two to some extent. :TODO:
        this doesn't always hide the characters after point leaves
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (defun org-toggle-emphasis-markers-at-point ()
          (save-match-data
            (when (or (org-in-regexp org-emph-re 2)
                      (org-in-regexp org-verbatim-re 2)
                      (org-in-regexp org-link-any-re 2))
              (if (and (>= (point) (match-beginning 3))
                       (<= (point) (match-end 4))
                       (member (match-string 3) (mapcar 'car org-emphasis-alist)))
                       ;; invisible check?
                  (with-silent-modifications
                    (remove-text-properties
                     (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5)
                     '(invisible org-link)))
                (apply 'font-lock-flush
                  (list (match-beginning 3) (match-beginning 5)))))))
        ```
        
        We run the above function after each command in an Org mode
        buffer. :TODO: improve this functionality before use.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
        ;  (lambda ()
        ;    (add-hook 'post-command-hook
        ;      'org-toggle-emphasis-markers-at-point nil t)))
        ```
    
    3.  Emphasis marker regexps
        
        Dumping this just for now… see
        <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/41111/org-mode-markup-between-square-brackets>
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (with-eval-after-load 'org
          ; chars for prematch
          (setcar org-emphasis-regexp-components            "     ('\"{“”\[\\-")
          ; chars for postmatch
          (setcar (nthcdr 1 org-emphasis-regexp-components) "\] -   .,!?;:''“”\")}/\\“”(-")
          ; forbidden chars
          (setcar (nthcdr 2 org-emphasis-regexp-components) "    \t\r\n\"")
          ; body
          (setcar (nthcdr 3 org-emphasis-regexp-components) ".")
          ; max newlines
          (setcar (nthcdr 4 org-emphasis-regexp-components) 1)
          (org-set-emph-re 'org-emphasis-regexp-components org-emphasis-regexp-components))
        ```
        
        I add ( to the second entry, to allow ( to immediately follow
        markup.
    
    4.  Require `{}` to denote sub/superscripts
        
        Sometimes I use the characters `_` and `^` to write subscripts
        and superscripts; however, when I do so, I want to be forced to
        use brackets to enclose the sub/superscripts.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})
        ```
    
    5.  Highlight math mode blocks
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex))
        ```
    
    6.  Pretty bullets
        
        Org bullets replaces the standard `*` in headers with prettier
        symbols.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package org-bullets
          :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))
        ```
    
    7.  Replace the ellipsis `...`
        
        By default, folded portions of the document are presented by an
        ellipsis, `...`. Let's replace that.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-ellipsis " ⮷")
        ```
        
        But I find this is not particularly visible with my theme; it
        gets set to a very faint colour. So, I customise the
        `org-ellipsis` face so that it has the same colour as the rest
        of the headline. It has to be set after every theme change, or
        the setting will be overwritten (probably the themes I use set
        it specifically?).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-hook 'after-load-theme-hook
          (lambda ()
            (set-face-attribute
              'org-ellipsis
              nil ;; all frames
              :foreground 'unspecified
            )
          )
        )
        ```
    
    8.  Tables
        
        I prefer to work with wordwrap on, so tables can be quite
        problematic.
        
        The solution is to set column widths so that we can collapse
        tables. In recent Org mode versions, we need to enable
        collapsing.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-startup-align-all-table t)
        ```
    
    9.  Inline images
        
        We can configure Org to automatically inline linked images when
        opening documents.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-startup-with-inline-images t)
        ```
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
        ```
    
    10. Tag position
        
        By default (as of Org 9.1.9), tags get shifted to the 77th
        column. But this causes blank lines to be inserted when working
        on narrower screens. I bump it down a good bit, to ensure tags
        stay away from the right side of the screen.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-tags-column 48)
        ```

7.  Other
    
    1.  Allow alphabetical lists
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-list-allow-alphabetical t)
        ```
    
    2.  Reveal hidden elements if they are edited
        
        To avoid, for instance, accidentally editing folded portions of
        the document.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq org-catch-invisible-edits 'show)
        ```
    
    3.  Inline tasks
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (require 'org-inlinetask)
        ```

### Org struct mode

Org struct mode lets us use Org-style document folding in other modes.

``` commonlisp
(add-hook 'agda2-mode 'turn-on-orgstruct++)
```

### `pdf-tools`

``` commonlisp
(use-package pdf-tools)
```

Need to “install” it each time emacs starts

``` commonlisp
(pdf-tools-install)
```

### `yankpad` and `yasnippets`

I use `yasnippets` for text expansion, and `yankpad` to organise my
snippets.

For inserting snippets, we require string manipulation functions from
the `subr-x` package (built-in).

``` commonlisp
(require 'subr-x)
```

``` commonlisp
(use-package yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode t)

(use-package yankpad)
(setq yankpad-file "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/yankpad.org")
```

`yas-wrap-around-region` controls what is inserted for a snippet's `$0`
field. A non-nil, non-character setting has it insert the current
region's contents (i.e. if we highlight a region and invoke a snippet,
the region will be wrapped).

``` commonlisp
(setq yas-wrap-around-region t)
```

`yas-indent-line` controls how inserted snippets are inserted. `fixed`
indicates the snippet should be indented to the column at point. `auto`
instead causes each line to be indented using
`indent-according-to-mode`. I set it to fixed because this is usually
what I want; I know best, not the mode.

``` commonlisp
(setq yas-indent-line 'fixed)
```

1.  Don't add a final newline when editing snippet files
    
    `yasnippets` will insert the final newline when expanding a snippet,
    so snippet files generally shouldn't include a final newline.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-hook 'snippet-mode-hook (setq require-final-newline nil))
    ```

### `dired`

I use `dired` for browsing directories; it's simple, and with the right
configuration, very easy to use.

1.  Display preferences
    
    `dired` makes use of switches for `ls`.
    
    I like the following switches:
    
    |                             |                                                              |
    | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `--group-directories-first` | group directories before files                               |
    | `-a`                        | do not ignore entries starting with .                        |
    | `-B`                        | do not list implied entries ending with \~                   |
    | `-g`                        | long listing format, but do not list owner                   |
    | `-G`                        | in a long listing, don't print group names                   |
    | `-h`                        | print human readable size                                    |
    | `-L`                        | show information for *references* rather than symbolic links |
    

    ``` commonlisp
    (setq dired-listing-switches "--group-directories-first -aBgGhL")
    ```

2.  Use only one buffer for `dired`
    
    I use `dired-single` to avoid `dired` opening a new buffer for every
    directory visited.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package dired-single)
    ```
    
    I use a “magic” buffer with the name `*Dired*`, to avoid the single
    `dired` buffer being named after whatever directory I first visit.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq dired-single-use-magic-buffer t)
    (setq dired-single-magic-buffer-name "*Dired*")
    ```
    
    The below code, which rebinds keys to use `dired-single` rather than
    `dired`, was originally based on code from the `dired-single`
    [GitHub readme](https://github.com/crocket/dired-single); but in
    recent versions of Emacs, `dired-load-hook` is obsolete, so we use
    `with-eval-after-load` instead.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (defun my/dired-init ()
      ;; Keyboard navigation should be rebound to dired-single
      (define-key dired-mode-map [return]  'dired-single-buffer)
      (define-key dired-mode-map "."       'dired-single-up-directory)
    
      ;; Emacs registers a mouse 1 click
      ;; if we click /beside/ a file/directory name.
      (define-key dired-mode-map [mouse-1] 'dired-single-buffer-mouse)
      ;; It registers a mouse 2 click
      ;; if we click /on/ a file/directory name.
      (define-key dired-mode-map [mouse-2] 'dired-single-buffer-mouse))
    
    ;; Deprecated code
    ;;;; if dired's already loaded, then the keymap will be bound
    ;;(if (boundp 'dired-mode-map)
    ;;        ;; we're good to go; just add our bindings
    ;;        (my/dired-init)
    ;;  ;; it's not loaded yet, so add our bindings to the load-hook
    ;;  (add-hook 'dired-load-hook 'my/dired-init))
    
    ;; Load the keybindings
    (with-eval-after-load 'dired
      (my/dired-init))
    ```

### `magit`

``` commonlisp
(use-package magit)
```

### Sending email: `send-mail`

Whether or not you use Emacs to read your email, you can use it to send
emails with the builtin `send-mail`. It can be configured to use your OS
default for sending email (for instance, through a mail program or
browser), or configured to send mail itself (for instance via SMTP). For
convenience, I choose the latter.

I use Gmail exclusively, so the setup is small.

``` commonlisp
(require 'smtpmail)

(setq send-mail-function    'smtpmail-send-it
      smtpmail-smtp-server  "smtp.gmail.com"
      smtpmail-stream-type  'ssl
      smtpmail-smtp-service 465)
```

If needed, we can create a queue to allow for sending of email while
offline. See [the
documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/Queued-delivery.html).

``` commonlisp
;;(setq smtpmail-queue-mail nil)
```

After sending an email, kill the buffer.

``` commonlisp
(setq message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)
```

1.  Sending HTML mail
    
    I usually prefer to send plaintext email, but if I want to send HTML
    for any reason, that can be done from Emacs as well.
    
    `org-mime` allows sending of HTML emails written in Org markdown; I
    don't use it yet, as I only send plaintext, but it may be handy
    later.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package org-mime)
    ```

### Reading email: `mu4e` (with isync)

Using Emacs as an email client provides us with powerful text editing
while composing email.

I initially followed the guide [from this reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e_for_dummies/)
to set it up, but I've customised things heavily at this point.

``` commonlisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
(require 'mu4e)
```

1.  Basic setup
    
    `mu4e` needs to know where my mail directory lives, and the paths of
    certain important mailboxes relative to that. Note that there should
    be an archive box here, but I don't make use of an archive mailbox.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq
      mu4e-maildir       "~/.mail/gmail"
      mu4e-drafts-folder "/Drafts"
      mu4e-sent-folder   "/Sent Mail"
      mu4e-trash-folder  "/Trash")
    ```
    
    I use isync (whose executable is called `mbsync`) to manage my local
    mail directory. I have two groups set up in my `mbsyncrc`; one
    smaller group which synchronises with the remote quickly, and one
    larger one. I make `mu4e` responsible for synchronising the smaller
    group regularly; this ensures that I get new emails fairly quickly.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ; get mail
    (setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync gmail-quick"
          mu4e-update-interval 60
          mu4e-headers-auto-update t)
    ```
    
    This is a bit of a dumb asynchronous process to update the rest of
    the mailboxes. Dumb in the sense that if anything ever goes wrong, I
    won't know about it.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (start-process "mbsync-gmail-rest"
                   "*mbsync gmail-rest*"
                   "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/mbsync-gmail-rest")
    ```
    
    It runs this shell process.
    
    ``` shell
    while :
    do
      echo "Beginning sync"
      date
      mbsync gmail-rest
      echo ""
      echo "Indexing with mu"
      mu index -m ~/.mail/gmail
      echo "Ended sync, sleeping for 30m"
      echo ""
      echo ""
      echo ""
      sleep 30m
    done
    ```
    
    By default, we would be prompted whether we want to kill this
    process upon exiting Emacs; I will always answer yes, so it's best
    just not to have it ask.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (set-process-query-on-exit-flag (get-process "mbsync-gmail-rest") nil)
    ```
    
    `mu4e` has an annoying habit of hogging the minibuffer while
    updating and indexing; unfortunately this means I prefer to silence
    its updating and indexing messages.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-hide-index-messages t)
    ```
    
    `mu/mu4e` normally keeps the base filename the same when moving mail
    to a different folder; with isync, it works better to change the
    name. See the documentation of this variable.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)
    ```

2.  Viewing emails
    
    1.  Email list
        
        This controls the information shown in the email lists.
        
          - `:human-date` will show the time if the email was sent today
            (the alternative, `:date`, would not).
          - `:from-or-to` is a special field that will show the sender
            if it was not me; otherwise it will show the recipient.
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-headers-fields
            '( (:date       . 22)
               (:flags      . 4)
               (:from-or-to . 22)
               (:subject    . nil)))
        ```
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-headers-date-format "%d %b/%y, %a, %R")
        ```
    
    2.  Individual mail
        
        Show images by default, and prefer to use `imagemagick` to do
        so.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-view-show-images t)
        
        (when (fboundp 'imagemagick-register-types)
          (imagemagick-register-types))
        ```
        
        Attachments can simply be placed in `~/Downloads`; I usually
        share this directory from ChromeOS, which makes it convenient to
        put attachments there (so I can open them in both OSes easily).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-attachment-dir  "~/Downloads")
        ```
        
        Show full email addresses when viewing messages.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-view-show-addresses 't)
        ```
    
    3.  HTML support
        
        Emacs is not the ideal environment to read HTML emails; for that
        reason, if there is a plaintext version available, I prefer to
        see that first.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq mu4e-view-prefer-html nil)
        ```
        
        If there is no plaintext available, or if the plaintext is
        unbearable for any reason, we can open emails in the browser by
        using this shortcut.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions
          '("ViewInBrowser" . mu4e-action-view-in-browser) t)
        ```

3.  Shortcuts to mailboxes
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
        '(("/Inbox"     . ?i)
          ("/Sent Mail" . ?s)
          ("/Trash"     . ?t)
          ("/Desk/1-Imminent"    . ?I)
          ("/Desk/2-Short term"  . ?S)
          ("/Desk/3-Reference"   . ?R)
          ("/Desk/4-Medium term" . ?M)
          ("/Desk/5-Long term"   . ?L)))
    ```

4.  Message composition settings
    
    I don't use a signature.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-compose-signature-auto-include nil)
    ```
    
    Part of the reason I like to use Emacs is to feel more in control of
    my text layout; for that reason, I don't want my text to be
    reflowed.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-compose-format-flowed nil)
    ```
    
    It's convenient not to reply to myself by default.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-compose-dont-reply-to-self t)
    ```
    
    1.  HTML support (nothing to see here)
        
        Note that there is a `org-mu4e` package that comes with `mu4e`,
        which would allow for sending HTML email using `mu4e`, but it is
        apparently depricated. The `org-mime` package above is probably
        the correct path if I ever want to send HTML emails.
    
    2.  Changing the `From` address automatically
        
        I use my personal Gmail to collect all of my emails, but when
        replying I like to send back from whichever account the original
        mail was sent to. This hook updates the `From` field when
        replying to an email sent to one of my other accounts. It is
        taken from [the `mu4e`
        documentation](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Compose-hooks.html#Compose-hooks).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-pre-hook
          (defun my-set-from-address ()
            "Set the From address based on the To address of the original."
            (let ((msg mu4e-compose-parent-message))
              (when msg
                (setq user-mail-address
                  (cond
                     ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to "armstmp@mcmaster.ca")
                       "armstmp@mcmaster.ca")
                     ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :cc "armstmp@mcmaster.ca")
                       "armstmp@mcmaster.ca")
                     (t
                       "markparmstrong@gmail.com")))))))
        ```

5.  Enabling Org-like folding in email composition
    
    :TODO: this doesn't work yet?
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)
    ```

6.  Miscellaneous
    
    Don't prompt me upon quitting `mu4e`.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq mu4e-confirm-quit nil)
    ```

### `winner` for saving and restoring window layouts

``` commonlisp
(winner-mode 1)
```

### `exwm`

I've considered using the Emacs window manager, `exwm`, but on my
Chromebook, I can't replace the window manager. So it remains simply a
possibility for the future.

``` commonlisp
;(use-package exwm)
;(require 'exwm-config)
;(exwm-config-default)
```

## Key bindings

I make use of `hydra` for keybindings (or groups of keybindings) which
will be executed several times in a row.

I also make use of `general` to organise other keybindings.

``` commonlisp
(use-package general)
```

### `general` definers

You can use `general-define-key` directly to define shortcuts, ideally
using the keyword argument `:prefix` to avoid repeating prefixes, but if
you are (even only possibly) using a prefix several times, it's better
to create a custom function to use instead of `general-define-key`.

Setting `:keymaps` to `'override` ensures that no package will override
my shortcuts.

For the moment, I'm experimenting with using `s`-key (“super”-key)
combinations as prefixes. I have my caps lock bound to super (on my
Chromebook's internal keyboard it's bound to that by default), and I
think if I restrict the combination keys to those on the left side of
the keyboard, I can avoid “Emacs pinky”.

So far I have three categories of shortcuts:

  - My main shortcuts, those that don't fall into another category.
  - Shortcuts to navigate around the current buffer.
  - Shortcuts to open a `dired` buffer for a certain folder.

<!-- end list -->

``` commonlisp
(general-create-definer general-main-define-key
  :prefix "s-q"
  :keymaps 'override)

(general-create-definer general-window-define-key
  :prefix "s-w"
  :keymaps 'override)

(general-create-definer general-dired-define-key
  :prefix "s-d"
  :keymaps 'override)
```

### Invoke processes

These bindings invoke various processes, such as `dired` or `eshell`.
They either have their own definer above, or are bound to a single key
combo.

1.  `yankpad`
    
    I use a non-prefixed shortcut for snippet expansion, since I do it
    all the time. (at least until yankpad has smart tab expansion).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-f" 'yankpad-expand)
    ```
    
    Alternatively, `y m` invokes `yankpad-map`, which brings up a keymap
    of the last tags of snippets.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-main-define-key
      "y m" 'yankpad-map)
    ```
    
    Changes to the yankpad file require `yankpad-reload` to be run to
    re-cache the snippets. For the moment, it seems like there is
    separate caching for each buffer, meaning this command has to be run
    in every buffer where I want changes to be picked up. So, I have a
    shortcut key.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-main-define-key
      "y r" 'yankpad-reload)
    ```

2.  `dired`
    
    1.  Jumping to specific buffers
        
        There are some files so commonly used, I want shortcuts directly
        to them (in fact, usually these files are perpetually kept
        open). These shortcuts then don't involve `dired`, but they are
        lumped in here anyway.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (general-dired-define-key
          "s" '(:ignore t :which-key "Scratch buffers")
          "sa" '((lambda () (interactive)
                   (find-file "~/Dropbox/McMaster/Agda/agda-scratch.agda"))
                 :which-key "Agda scratch")
          "so" '((lambda () (interactive)
                   (find-file "~/Dropbox/Organisation/org-scratch.org"))
                 :which-key "Org scratch")
          "e" '((lambda () (interactive)
                   (find-file "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/emacs-init.org"))
                 :which-key "Emacs init")
        )
        ```
    
    2.  Files not(?) already opened
        
        I use shortcuts to jump to frequently used directories in
        `dired` (from any buffer, not just while in `dired`).
        
        As seen in `Cosmetics`, I use `dired-single` in order to only
        have one `dired` buffer at a time. In case this changes, I
        define another local variable to store the command to invoke
        `dired` with.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (defun my-dired-invocation (directory)
          "My custom dired invocation.
           It will use my special “magic buffer” for browsing."
          (dired-single-magic-buffer directory))
        ```
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (general-dired-define-key
          "c" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation default-directory))
                :which-key "Current")
          "h" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~"))
                :which-key "Home")
          "d" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/"))
                :which-key "Dropbox")
          "o" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/Organisation/"))
                :which-key "Organisation")
          "r" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/Organisation/reading/"))
                :which-key "Organisation")
          "p" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/Projects/"))
                :which-key "Projects")
          "m" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/McMaster/"))
                :which-key "McMaster")
          "a" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/McMaster/Agda/"))
                :which-key "Agda")
          "t" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/McMaster/Agda/thesis/"))
                :which-key "Thesis")
          "3" '(:ignore t :which-key "3rd year classes")
          "3m" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/McMaster/3mi3/"))
                :which-key "3mi3")
          "3e" '((lambda () (interactive)
                  (my-dired-invocation "~/Dropbox/McMaster/3ea3/"))
                :which-key "3ea3")
        )
        ```

3.  `eshell`
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-s" 'eshell)
    ```

4.  `magit`
    
    I often find myself using `s-g` in place of `c-g` when using my
    keybindings (which begin with super). So, I avoid using it for
    starting `magit`.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-v" 'magit-status
    )
    ```

5.  `mu4e`
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-m" 'mu4e
    )
    ```

6.  `recentf`
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-r" 'recentf-open-files
    )
    ```

7.  `list-processes`
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (general-define-key
      "s-p" 'list-processes
    )
    ```

### Buffer navigation and management, window and theme management

Somewhat sinfully, here I group shortcuts relating to the buffer, the
window(s) and the cosmetics of the frame, into one (conceptual)
category: “window”, prefix `w`.

``` commonlisp
(general-window-define-key
  "r" '((lambda () (interactive) (revert-buffer () t ()))
        :which-key "Revert buffer")
  "u" '((lambda () (interactive) (undo-tree-visualize))
        :which-key "Undo tree")

  "s"   '(:ignore t
          :which-key "Session management")
  "s c" '((lambda () (interactive) (desktop-clear))
          :which-key "Session clear")

  "b"   '(:ignore t
          :which-key "Buffer navigation")
  "b t" '((lambda () (interactive) (beginning-of-buffer))
          :which-key "Top of buffer")
  "b b" '((lambda () (interactive) (end-of-buffer))
          :which-key "Bottom of buffer")

  "t"   '(:ignore t
          :which-key "Theme management")
  "t t" '((lambda () (interactive) (toggle-my-themes))
          :which-key "Toggle theme")
  "t c" '((lambda () (interactive) (disable-all-custom-themes))
          :which-key "Clear theme")

  "<right>" '((lambda () (interactive) (windmove-right))
              :which-key "Move focus right")
  "<left>"  '((lambda () (interactive) (windmove-left))
              :which-key "Move focus left")
  "<up>"    '((lambda () (interactive) (windmove-up))
              :which-key "Move focus up")
  "<down>"  '((lambda () (interactive) (windmove-down))
              :which-key "Move focus down")

  "\\" '((lambda () (interactive)
                 (cascading-find-files my-initial-files))
         :which-key "My initial windows")
  "["  '(winner-undo
         :which-key "Undo layout change")
  "]"  '(winner-redo
         :which-key "Redo layout change")

  "-"     '((lambda () (interactive) (shrink-window 5))
            :which-key "Shrink window")
  "="     '((lambda () (interactive) (enlarge-window 5))
            :which-key "Enlarge window")
  "_"     '((lambda () (interactive) (shrink-window 999))
            :which-key "“Minimise” window")
  "+"     '((lambda () (interactive) (enlarge-window 999))
            :which-key "“Maximise”  window")

  "o"   '(:ignore t
          :which-key "Org cosmetics")
  "o i"   '(:ignore t
            :which-key "Org indent")
  "o i y" '((lambda () (interactive) (org-indent-mode 1))
            :which-key "Org indent yes")
  "o i n" '((lambda () (interactive) (org-indent-mode 0))
            :which-key "Org indent no")
)
```

### Other

These are cosmetics relating to lines in the current buffer.

``` commonlisp
(general-main-define-key
  "l"     '(:ignore t
            :which-key "Line cosmetics")
  "l n"   '(:ignore t
            :which-key "Line numbers")
  "l n y" '((lambda () (interactive) (display-line-numbers-mode 1))
            :which-key "Line numbers - yes")
  "l n n" '((lambda () (interactive) (display-line-numbers-mode 0))
            :which-key "Line numbers - no")
  "l w"   '(:ignore t
            :which-key "Line wrap")
  "l w y" '((lambda () (interactive) (visual-line-mode 1))
            :which-key "Line wrap - yes")
  "l w n" '((lambda () (interactive) (visual-line-mode 0))
            :which-key "Line wrap - no")
;; Line highlighting has been reduced; I don't need this anymore.
;  "l h"   '(:ignore t
;            :which-key "Long line highlighting")
;  "l h y" '((lambda () (interactive) (whitespace-mode 1))
;            :which-key "Long line hightlight - yes")
;  "l h n" '((lambda () (interactive) (whitespace-mode 0))
;            :which-key "Long line hightlight - yes")
)
```

``` commonlisp
(general-main-define-key
  "j" 'dad-joke
)
```

## Navigation

### Jump between windows using `windmove`

The package `windmove` lets us jump between windows in a frame.

``` commonlisp
(use-package windmove)
```

For the uninitiated, a *window* in Emacs is not the same as the OS
window. Each OS window is a *frame*, and each pane within a frame is
called a *window*. (Emacs predates modern terminology).

`windmove` lets us move between windows with the arrow keys while
holding a key; by default, the key is `shift`. That conflicts with `org`
though, so we could use `windmove-default-keybindings` to change it.

Unfortunately, on my system, all the other possibilities seem to be
taken with system shortcuts (which I cannot modify in ChromeOS), or
otherwise taken in Emacs.

So instead I've defined shortcuts using `general` above.

### Change scrolling (shortcut) behaviour

I find the scrolling shortcuts `scroll-up-command` (`C-v`) and
`scroll-down-command` (`M-v`) “too aggressive”. They scroll the screen
by nearly the whole window height, by default leaving visible only 2
lines which were visible.

I find adjusting this upwards makes it easier to follow along with a
document as scrolling.

``` commonlisp
(setq next-screen-context-lines 16)
```

Keep in mind `recenter` (`C-l`) when scrolling this way to recenter the
screen on the current line.

## Cosmetics

### Fonts

I like the Cousine font, and usually use a small 11in screen, and so use
a small font; 9pt seems to be a sweet spot.

``` commonlisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
             '(font . "Cousine-9"))
```

### Themes

I use Doom themes. By default, I prefer a dark theme, but like to toggle
between it and a light theme at need.

``` commonlisp
(use-package doom-themes)

(setq my/dark-theme 'doom-vibrant)
(setq my/light-theme 'doom-nord-light)

(load-theme my/dark-theme t)
```

This is recommended for making the Doom themes “play nice” with Org.

``` commonlisp
(doom-themes-org-config)
```

1.  Toggling the themes
    
    These functions allow me to clear and toggle my themes.
    
    ``` commonlisp

### Displaying/removing information and interface elements

There are several tweaks I like to display important information and
hide unimportant information or interfact elements.

1.  Remove unnecessary interface elements
    
    Emacs usually shows a splash screen on startup, which doesn't
    interest me.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
    ```
    
    I don't use the tool bar (icons below the menu bar). (This setting
    must be `-1`, not `nil`).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    ```
    
    I also don't use the menu bar. (Again, this must be `-1`, not
    `nil`).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (menu-bar-mode -1)
    ```
    
    I also disable the scroll bars.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)
    ```

2.  Prompts for important things
    
    I rarely *actually* want to close Emacs, so it should always prompt
    if I accidentally ask to close.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
    ```

3.  The mode line
    
    1.  Taking the Spacemacs modeline
        
        While I don't use Spacemacs, I do like it's sleek modeline.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package spaceline)
        ```
        
        Using `spaceline-emacs-theme` instead of
        `spaceline-spacemacs-theme` should improve compatibility.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (spaceline-emacs-theme)
        ```
    
    2.  Information to display
        
        :TODO:
    
    3.  Colour the beginning of the line based on the save status of the
        file
        
        This setting changes the colour of the start of the modeline
        when the file has been modified and not saved, a nice subtle
        reminder to save.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (setq spaceline-highlight-face-func
          'spaceline-highlight-face-modified)
        ```
        
        In fact, let's make that colouring constant across themes.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (custom-theme-set-faces
         'user
         ;; The active buffer has a fairly vibrant blue modeline
         '(mode-line         ((t (:foreground "black"
                                  :background "DeepSkyBlue1"))))
         '(powerline-active0 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                  :background "DeepSkyBlue2"))))
         '(powerline-active1 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                  :background "DeepSkyBlue3"))))
         '(powerline-active2 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                     :background "DeepSkyBlue4"))))
        
         ;; The inactive buffers have less vibrant gray/blue modelines
         '(mode-line-inactive  ((t (:foreground "black"
                                    :background "LightSkyBlue1"))))
         '(powerline-inactive0 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                    :background "LightSkyBlue2"))))
         '(powerline-inactive1 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                    :background "LightSkyBlue3"))))
         '(powerline-inactive2 ((t (:foreground "black"
                                     :background "LightSkyBlue4"))))
        
         ;; Highlighting based on save status of buffer
         '(spaceline-unmodified ((t (:foreground "black"
                                     :background "green1"))))
         '(spaceline-modified   ((t (:foreground "black"
                                     :background "gold1"))))
         '(spaceline-read-only  ((t (:foreground "black"
                                     :background "seashell1"))))
        )
        (powerline-reset)
        ```
    
    4.  Flash on error
        
        The doom themes package comes with a function to make the mode
        line flash on error.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
        ```
        
        I'd previously just used `visible-bell`, but it's a bit nosier
        than necessary.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;;(setq visible-bell t)
        ```
    
    5.  Diminish minor mode names
        
        I use a lot of minor modes, so the mode list takes up a lot of
        space on the mode line.
        
        `diminish-mode` alleviates this by allowing us to hide modes or
        give them shorter names.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (use-package diminish)
        ```
        
        I don't need to see that these modes are active.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (eval-after-load "yas-minor-mode" '(diminish 'yas-minor-mode))
        (eval-after-load "yasnippet" '(diminish 'yas-minor-mode))
        (eval-after-load "undo-tree" '(diminish 'undo-tree-mode))
        (eval-after-load "which-key" '(diminish 'which-key-mode))
        (eval-after-load "org-indent" '(diminish 'org-indent-mode))
        ```
        
        If later I want to rename modes, just add a string argument to
        the above form with a (presumably shorter) name.

4.  Show line numbers on left
    
    As of Emacs 26, `display-line-numbers-mode` is the “proper” way to
    display line numbers next to a buffer.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;; (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
    
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)
    ```
    
    I find it concerning when the width of the column used for line
    numbers grows throughout the document; it makes me think Org mode
    headlines further down are nested. Setting
    `display-line-numbers-width-start` causes the system to count the
    number of lines when opening a buffer, and set the minimum width
    necessary to display all line numbers. It wastes some screen space,
    but is good for my sanity.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq display-line-numbers-width-start t)
    ```
    
    Since line numbers can be distracting in some instances, see
    [1.4](#Key%20bindings) for toggles to turn it off.
    
    1.  For older versions of Emacs
        
        In older versions, we can use `linum-mode`, but
        
          - it interacts poorly with `pdf-tools`, so we don't want to
            enable it globally, and
          - it makes Emacs quite laggy when working with larger files.
        
        So I generally just work without line numbers in older versions.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;;(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'linum-mode)
        ;;(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'linum-mode)
        ```

5.  Parentheses
    
    It's nice to highlight the matching parentheses when the cursor is
    on its match.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (show-paren-mode 1)
    ```
    
    …
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package rainbow-delimiters)
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
    ```

6.  Display tabs
    
    I usually use spaces rather than tabs, so I use `whitespace-mode` to
    alert me to the presence of tabs.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (global-whitespace-mode t)
    ```
    
    Setting `whitespace-style` to `tab-mark` visualises tabs by changing
    the display table to show a character at the location of the tab.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq whitespace-style '(tab-mark))
    ```
    
    1.  Deprecated – more whitespace highlighting
        
        I previously used `whitespace-style` to highlight trailing
        whitespace; however, I find this feature intrusive, so I avoid
        it.
        
        If it is wanted later, then I should add to the list
        
        ``` example
        (face trailing)
        ```
        
        We need to add `face` to the list, to enable using faces to
        highlight whitespace.
        
        Note there is no way to visualise spaces only at the end of
        lines; The visualisation is done by changing the display table,
        and there is no ability to do so only in particular places.
        Otherwise I would use that rather than highlighting.

7.  Show ruler at 70 characters for (for `text` and `prog` mode)
    
    It's good style to keep lines under 80 characters wide. The built in
    `display-fill-column-indicator-mode` puts a ruler, by default at 70
    characters.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode t)
    ```
    
    Note that with `org-indent-mode`, the ruler will be off by the
    length of the indentation (i.e. it will be at line 68 if indented 2
    characters, 66 if indented 4, etc).
    
    1.  Deprecated – `fci-mode`
        
        In earlier versions of Emacs (\< 27), the package
        `fill-column-indicator` could be used to get the fill column
        ruler.
        
        Note that this seems to cause some noticable lag.
        
        The code to make it a global mode is from the [Emacs
        wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FillColumnIndicator).
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;;(use-package fill-column-indicator)
        ;;(define-globalized-minor-mode global-fci-mode
        ;;  fci-mode (lambda () (fci-mode t)))
        ;;(global-fci-mode t)
        ```
        
        If I later need it enabled only for certain modes, this code
        could be of use.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        ;; (use-package fill-column-indicator)
        ;; (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'fci-mode)
        ;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'fci-mode)
        ```
        
        After some use, I've found this indicator to be a combination of
        distracting and possibly causing some lag, so I no longer use
        it. `whitespace-mode` (set up above) makes a good alternative.

8.  More noticable divider between windows
    
    One problem with a fill column ruler is that it can seem like it is
    the divider between windows.
    
    For that reason, I like to have a more noticable divider between
    windows. `window-divider-mode` provides this.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (window-divider-mode)
    ```
    
    The default settings seem fine for the moment, so no customisation
    here.

9.  Don't wrap lines
    
    Since I make an effort to keep my lines under 80 characters, I
    usually won't have lines too long for the window.
    
    Previously, I enabled `visual-line-mode` to “wrap” lines which are
    too long; This is very annoying when working with a file with lots
    of long lines, so I no longer enable it by default. There is a
    shortcut under [1.4](#Key%20bindings) to toggle it if needed.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;; Enable line wrapping everywhere; not recommended.
    ;; (global-visual-line-mode t)
    
    ;; Enable line wrapping almost everywhere; also not recommended.
    ;;(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
    ;;(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'visual-line-mode)
    ```
    
    1.  Disable builtin line wrapping
        
        Emacs wraps lines in some modes by default (I am honestly unsure
        which modes). We can disable this by setting `truncate-lines` to
        `t` by default.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (set-default 'truncate-lines t)
        ```
    
    2.  Killing lines in `visual-line-mode`
        
        One annoying feature of `visual-line-mode`, at least in recent
        versions, is that it redefines a kill to only kill to the end of
        the visual line, rather than the whole line. This design
        decision can be reversed; thanks to the [Stack
        overflow](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/13279/)
        contributor.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (define-key visual-line-mode-map [remap kill-line] 'kill-line)
        ```
        
        Org mode also interferes with killing the whole line; it rebinds
        `C-k` to be `org-kill-line`, which seems to kill the visual
        line. Let's undo that rebinding.
        
        ``` commonlisp
        (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key org-mode-map "\C-k" 'kill-line)))
        ```

10. Emoticons
    
    I was using this package to add support for unicode emoticon
    characters, which did not display correctly otherwise (no font I had
    handled them?). Improving my unicode font support seems to be a
    better idea; in particular, one problem with `emojify` is it changes
    characters such as `↔` (left to right arrow) to emoticons, which I
    definitely do not want.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    ;;(use-package emojify)
    ;;(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-emojify-mode)
    ```
    
    Instead, it's best to just install fonts supporting the unicode
    characters I want. In particular, the Symbola font, which on Debian
    can be installed via the `fonts-symbola` package.
    
    :TODO: Look into more efficiently handling fallback fonts. It might
    be somewhat inefficient to leave it up to Emacs to search my system
    for appropriate fonts to display characters. See
    <https://idiocy.org/emacs-fonts-and-fontsets.html> and
    <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/17205/>.
    
    There's also this package to help with Unicode fonts, but it doesn't
    seem necessary for me.
    <https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts>

11. Dim buffers when not in use
    
    The package `dimmer` will dim inactive windows to emphasise which
    window has focus. See its [Github
    page](https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (use-package dimmer)
    ```
    
    Turn `dimmer-mode` on when Emacs starts.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (dimmer-mode)
    ```
    
    Don't dim `which-key` and `helm` buffers.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (dimmer-configure-which-key)
    (dimmer-configure-helm)
    ```
    
    We can adjust the `:foreground` colours, the `:background` colours,
    or `:both`. With a dark theme, adjusting the background causes the
    background to become lighter in inactive buffers, which “looks
    wrong” (makes them looked like they have focus). So I set this to
    just `:foreground` (which is the default anyway).
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq dimmer-adjustment-mode :foreground)
    ```
    
    I find the default dimming of `20%` to be too faint; it is
    noticeable when changing windows, but it does not remain noticeable
    enough later (e.g. when I look away from Emacs then look back).
    Doubling that to `40%` seems to be sufficient, while maintaing the
    readability of unfocussed buffers.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq dimmer-fraction 0.4)
    ```
    
    Note that by default, all windows will be dimmer when Emacs notices
    that it does not have focus in the windowing system. I like this
    behaviour; it could be changed by changing the variable
    `dimmer-watch-frame-focus-events`.

### Automatically revert unchanged files which change on the disk

``` commonlisp
(global-auto-revert-mode t)
```

### <span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Use `wordsmith` for English syntax highlighting

``` commonlisp
(use-package wordsmith-mode)
```

### Show possible completions as I type shortcuts

``` commonlisp
(use-package which-key)
(which-key-mode)
```

### Provide a visualisation of my undo tree

In Emacs, changes to a buffer are stored using a tree, rather than a
stack.

In most editors if we revert to an earlier state using “undo” and then
make some changes, we can no longer reach the state *before* the “undo”,
because it was popped of the stack and is now lost (the “redo” stack was
lost when we made changes).

This doesn't happen with an “undo tree”\!

I like to think of the undo tree as “extemely local” version control.

The package `undo-tree` provides a visualisation of the undo tree.

``` commonlisp
(use-package undo-tree)
(global-undo-tree-mode)
```

I like each node in the undo tree to have a timestamp; it helps identify
the node I want to return to.

``` commonlisp
(setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
```

We can have a “diff” window display the changes made at each node in the
undo tree.

Unfortunately this seems to introduce a fair amount of lag on my system.

``` commonlisp
;;(setq undo-tree-visualizer-diff ())
```

### Session (opened buffers) setup and management

1.  Buffers to open at startup
    
    I like a bunch of files open (in the background) upon startup.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq my-initial-background-files
      '("~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/tips-and-tricks.org"
        "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/yankpad.org"
        "~/Dropbox/McMaster/Agda/agda-scratch.agda"
        "~/Dropbox/Organisation/log/phone-log.org"
    ))
    ```
    
    Along with this list, to facilite reseting the session (*clearing
    the desktop*), we must maintain a list of regular expressions
    matching the resulting buffer names, so that they can be skipped
    when deleting buffers on a (soft) reset.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq my-initial-background-buffers-regexps
      '("tips-and-tricks.org"
        "yankpad.org"
        "agda-scratch.agda"
        "phone-log.org"
    ))
    ```
    
    Then there are files I want in focus (*on the desktop*) at startup.
    These are opened using my `my-desktop-initialise` (defined above),
    with the earlier files being to the right of and above the later
    files. The last file will be in focus.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq my-initial-files
      '("~/Dropbox/Organisation/log/log.org"
        "~/Dropbox/Organisation/setup/emacs/emacs-init.org"
        "~/Dropbox/Organisation/org-scratch.org"
    ))
    ```
    
    As above, we need a list of regular expression matching the
    resulting buffer names.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (setq my-initial-buffers-regexps
      '("log.org"
        "emacs-init.org"
        "org-scratch.org"
    ))
    ```

2.  Opening the initial buffers
    
    Note that this portion of the file should be *after* any settings
    that would affect these buffers. Otherwise those settings will not
    apply in these buffers.
    
    This portion of the file should only be run if the Emacs process is
    not headless. In the case that Emacs is (presumably) running as a
    daemon, as it does when initiating an asynchronous process such as
    an Org async export process.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (if (display-graphic-p)
      (progn
       (loop for file in my-initial-background-files
         do (find-file file)
       )
       (cascading-find-files my-initial-files)
       (shrink-window 999) ;; basically minimize it vertically
      )
    )
    ```

3.  Buffers to preserve on session clear
    
    Emac's internal buffers are preserved on a session clear, but I
    additionally want to preserve the buffers I open on startup.
    
    ``` commonlisp
    (loop for buffer-re in my-initial-background-buffers-regexps
      do (add-to-list 'desktop-clear-preserve-buffers
                      buffer-re)
    )
    (loop for buffer-re in my-initial-buffers-regexps
      do (add-to-list 'desktop-clear-preserve-buffers
                      buffer-re)
    )
    ```

### Smoother scrolling

``` commonlisp
(setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))) ;; one line at a time
(setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed t) ;; don't accelerate scrolling
```

### “All the icons”

The package `all-the-icons` makes certain modes prettier by adding icons
for filetypes, etc.

``` commonlisp
(use-package all-the-icons)
```

Note we must run `all-the-icons-install-fonts` in order to install the
icons.

`dired` is probably the most important usage of this for me.

``` commonlisp
(use-package all-the-icons-dired
  :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode))
```

## Other

### Run my custom “dropbox start” command to ensure dropbox is running on the system

``` commonlisp
(start-process-shell-command "dropbox-start"
                             "*dropbox-start*"
                             "/opt/dropbox-filesystem-fix/dropbox_start.py")
```

### Always use buffer input mode in mini buffer

Some commands which make use of the minibuffer don't use the input mode
I have set (Agda input mode); this is very annoying, so I set a hook to
always use the input mode of the current buffer when entering the
minibuffer.

Notably, `string-rectangle` was where I encountered this all the time.
The solution below was linked to in this [Agda
issue](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3993); this StackExchange
[post](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38310) provides the
solution.

``` commonlisp
(defun my-inherit-input-method ()
  "Inherit input method from `minibuffer-selected-window'."
  (let* ((win (minibuffer-selected-window))
         (buf (and win (window-buffer win))))
    (when buf
      (activate-input-method (buffer-local-value 'current-input-method buf)))))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'my-inherit-input-method)
```

## Temporary fixes

Herein I collect any workarounds I use to solve problems temporarily.

These should be truly temporary\!

### `org-strip-quotes`

In some versions of Org, `org-strip-quotes` was used in export
functions, but is not defined\! It should be in `lisp/org-macs.el`.

So I just define it here.

``` commonlisp
(defun org-strip-quotes (string)
  "Strip double quotes from around STRING, if applicable.
If STRING is nil, return nil."
  (org-unbracket-string "\"" "\"" string))
```

## Generating the README.md for my Emacs repo

This code generates a `README.md` file for my Emacs repo, including this
file and other relevant files.

**NOTE:** if the readme ceases to be updated when running this, check if
we need to wait longer on `pandoc` (increase the argument to
`sleep-for`). Admittedly, it's a hack to just sleep.

## Scratch

### Find file alias for ease of use in eshell

``` commonlisp

### Bibliography setup

Stolen from Musa's configuration.

``` commonlisp
(use-package org-ref
  :custom ;; Files to look at when no “╲bibliography{⋯}”
          ;; is present in a file.
          ;; Most useful for non-LaTeX files.
        (reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/McMaster/references.bib"))
        (bibtex-completion-bibliography (car reftex-default-bibliography))
        (org-ref-default-bibliography reftex-default-bibliography))

;; Quick BibTeX references, sometimes.

# `yankpad.org`

## Description

### Introduction

This `org-mode` file contains commonly repeated snippets of text which I
expand using `yankpad` along with `yasnippets`.

Specifically, `yankpad` caches the snippets defined in this file, and
allows them to be expanded from a keyword with `yankpad-expand` or
selected from a keymap with `yankpad-map`.

With `yasnippets` installed (and its minor-mode active), the contents of
the snippets are actually executed using `yasnippets`, which provides a
great deal of functionality, including tab fields and arbitrary lisp
code execution.

### Organisation notes

The outermost headings of this file separate it into *categories*.
Snippets in a category named after a mode are available for yanking when
that mode is active. Other category's snippets can be made available by
switching to that category with `yankpad-set-category`. Snippets in
categories marked `:global:` are always available.

Inside categories, I use subheadings to organise snippets. The *lowest
level* headings define individual snippets.

Headings of snippets have the form `expandkeys: Name :settings:key:`,
where

  - `expandkeys` is a `:` separated list of keys for the snippet which
    can be expanded with `yankpad-expand`,
  - `Name` is the name of the snippet,
  - `settings` is `:` separated list of settings for the snippets,
    possibly including
      - `src`, which marks the snippet as being literate; only the
        contents of code blocks in such snippets are inserted.
      - `func`, which marks the snippet as a function. In this case no
        text is inserted; instead the code blocks of the snippet are
        executed.
      - `results`, which acts like `func`, but in this case, the
        *results* of the code blocks inside the snippet are inserted.

Most of my snippets are marked `:src:`, since this *is* a literate file
(and I don't tend to use snippets for executing code).

### Caveats

Sometimes snippets seem to act oddly in this file; specifically snippets
from lower in the file won't expand higher in the file (sometimes).

For that reason, the `org` mode snippets come first, as they are useful
for adding to this file.

## org-mode

I use `org` all the time, so you'll note in the `:properties:` drawer
that I include snippets from lots of other modes, since I often write
code from other modes in `org`.

I sometime use Org syntax outside of Org mode, so also see the
[2.3](#Default) category for more Org-related snippets.

### Other

1.  Gmail filters
    
    These XML snippets are for creating filters for my Gmail account,
    based on various criteria.
    
    1.  gmfto: Gmail filter by “to”
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="gmfto"><span class="smallcaps">gmfto</span></span>
        
        ``` xml
        <entry> <category term='filter'></category>
          <title>$1</title>
          <apps:property
              name='to'
              value='$1'/>
          <apps:property
              name='label'
              value='$2'/>
          ${3:<apps:property
              name='shouldMarkAsRead'
              value='true'/>}
          ${4:<apps:property
              name='shouldArchive'
              value='true'/>}
        </entry>
        ```
    
    2.  gmffrom: Gmail filter by “from”
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="gmffrom"><span class="smallcaps">gmffrom</span></span>
        
        ``` xml
        <entry> <category term='filter'></category>
          <title>$1</title>
          <apps:property
              name='from'
              value='$1'/>
          <apps:property
              name='label'
              value='$2'/>
          ${3:<apps:property
              name='shouldMarkAsRead'
              value='true'/>}
          ${4:<apps:property
              name='shouldArchive'
              value='true'/>}
        </entry>
        ```

## Default <span class="tag" data-tag-name="global"><span class="smallcaps">global</span></span>

The category “Default” will be used if there is no category for the
current major mode.

I make these snippets available everywhere else as well by marking the
category as `:global:`.

### Org related

I often use Org syntax outside of Org mode, especially when writing
literate Agda documents. So many Org syntax snippets are included here
to be available everywhere.

1.  dh: Document header
    <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgdh"><span class="smallcaps">orgdh</span></span>
    
    I usually use what I think is a fairly minimalist document header.
    
    ``` text
    #+Title: $1
    #+Author: ${2:Mark Armstrong}
    #+Description: $3
    
    $0
    ```

2.  `org` blocks

3.  `src` blocks
    
    Note that the `,#` expands to the `org` “comment” character `#`.
    
    This is needed to have a `#+end_src` *inside* a `src` block.
    
    1.  src: Generic source block
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgsrc"><span class="smallcaps">orgsrc</span></span>
        
        ``` text
        #+begin_src $1
        $0
        #+end_src
        ```
    
    2.  el: Emacs lisp block
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgel"><span class="smallcaps">orgel</span></span>

    3.  t: Plaintext
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgt"><span class="smallcaps">orgt</span></span>
        
        ``` text
        #+begin_src text
        $0
        #+end_src
        ```
    
    4.  latex: LaTeX
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orglatex"><span class="smallcaps">orglatex</span></span>
        
        ``` text
        #+begin_src latex
        $0
        #+end_src
        ```
    
    5.  sh: Shell
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgsh"><span class="smallcaps">orgsh</span></span>
        
        ``` text
        #+begin_src shell
        $0
        #+end_src
        ```
    
    6.  ag: Agda code block
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgag"><span class="smallcaps">orgag</span></span>
        
        ``` text
        #+begin_src agda2
        $0
        #+end_src
        ```
    
    7.  ga: Breaking Agda code blocks
        <span class="tag" data-tag-name="src"><span class="smallcaps">src</span></span> <span class="tag" data-tag-name="orgga"><span class="smallcaps">orgga</span></span>
        
        In Agda-Org mode (a Polymode), the Agda `src` blocks are in Agda
        mode, meaning that Org's “demarcate block” command isn't
        available for breaking up source blocks. So use this snippet
        instead.
        
        ``` text
        #+end_src
        
        #+begin_src agda2
        ```
    
    8.  oz: Oz code block
